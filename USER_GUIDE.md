## Troubleshooting

### I cannot open Home, Meals, Track, Insights, or Profile.

You are probably using guest mode. Sign in or create an account first.

### I signed in but still see a required profile modal.

Complete birthdate, weight, and height. These fields are required for personalized recommendations.

### Food recommendations are empty.

Try these checks:

- Make sure your profile is complete.
- Make sure the backend is running.
- Make sure the AI service is running.
- Try tracking a few meals first.

### AI explanation or behavioral insight is unavailable.

The AI service may be offline, Redis may be unavailable, or the Gemini API key may be missing.

### My dashboard data looks outdated.

Try adding a meal again or revisiting the page. Authenticated actions usually refresh profile stats automatically after saving.
